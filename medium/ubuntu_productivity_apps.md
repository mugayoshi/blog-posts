# Improve Your Ubuntu Workflow with These Essential Productivity Apps

In this article, I'm sharing a couple of my personal favourites that I use every day on my Ubuntu machine. These apps help me stay focused, manage my work efficiently, and ultimately, get more done.

## 1. Diodon: A Lightweight Clipboard Manager

If you're looking for a simple, no-frills clipboard manager, Diodon is an excellent choice. It's incredibly lightweight and easy to use, integrating seamlessly with the GNOME desktop environment.

### Why I Love It

The main selling point of Diodon is its simplicity. It does one thing, and it does it well: it keeps a history of your copied text. This is a lifesaver when you need to retrieve something you copied a few minutes ago but have since copied something else.

### Room for Improvement

However, Diodon's simplicity is also its some drawbacks. It lacks some of the advanced features you might find in other clipboard managers:

*   **No Image Support:** You can only copy and paste text, not images.
*   **Limited Shortcuts:** There isn't a default shortcut to quickly bring up the clipboard history, which can slow you down.
*   **No Index-Based Pasting:** You can't, for example, press a key combination to paste the second-to-last item in your history.

**The Verdict:** Diodon is perfect for users who want a minimal, resource-friendly clipboard manager. If you need more advanced features like image support or powerful keyboard shortcuts, you might want to look at alternatives like **CopyQ**.[https://copyq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html](https://copyq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

## 2. GNOME Pomodoro: Master Your Focus

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. The GNOME Pomodoro app is a fantastic tool for implementing this technique on your Ubuntu desktop.

### Why It's Great for Focus

This app is more than just a simple timer. It's designed to help you stay in the zone and avoid burnout.

*   **Full-Screen Notifications:** When a Pomodoro session or a break ends, it displays a full-screen notification that's hard to ignore. This is great for reminding you to take a much-needed break or to get back to work.
*   **Flexible Breaks:** You can easily skip a rest period if you're in the middle of a flow state and want to keep going.
*   **Gentle Reminders:** The app gives you a heads-up before a session or break is about to end, so you're not caught off guard.

### A Minor Quibble

My only small complaint is with the top bar integration. It displays a circle that fills up as the timer progresses, but it doesn't show the exact remaining time. You have to click on the icon to see the details. It's a minor issue, but having the exact time visible at a glance would be a nice touch.

**The Verdict:** If you're a fan of the Pomodoro Technique or just want a better way to manage your time and focus, the GNOME Pomodoro app is a must-have. It's a simple yet powerful tool that can significantly improve your productivity.



## Final Thoughts 

Writing this article led me to an interesting discovery. While I've been content with Diodon's simplicity, researching alternatives reminded me that there's always something new to try. I was particularly impressed by the feature set of **CopyQ**, and I'm planning to give it a spin to see if it can further optimise my workflow.
